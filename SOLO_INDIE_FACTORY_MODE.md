# SOLO_INDIE_FACTORY_MODE

## STRATEGY

- Build multiple small products.
- Avoid large-scale complex systems.
- Prefer simple core loops.
- Focus on speed of development.
- Reuse proven templates and code across products.

## MVP_RULE

- MVP must be achievable under 45-60 days.
- Core loop must be playable before polish.
- Monetization integrated before beta.
- Ship with one clear hook and one clear retention trigger.

## NO_COMPLEXITY_POLICY

- No server dependency.
- No multiplayer.
- No live service system.
- No seasonal content structure.
- No analytics infrastructure required at start.
- No custom tools unless manual workflow is a hard blocker.

## MAINTENANCE_RULE

- Keep systems simple.
- Avoid heavy content pipelines.
- Avoid features that require long-term updates.
- Prefer low-ops assets and deterministic build workflows.

## SUCCESS_MODEL

- Multiple small earning products > One big risky product.
- Ship → Observe → Improve lightly → Move on.
- Kill weak ideas fast, reinvest only into proven traction.

## EXECUTION_RULE

- Limit active products to max 2 at a time.
- Weekly cadence: Build (Mon-Thu), Launch (Fri), Review (Weekend).
- Define stop-loss criteria before development starts.
- If no traction window is met, archive and start next product.
