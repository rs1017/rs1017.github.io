# RS1017 Mobile Product System - Blog Rules

## 1. Purpose

- This blog is not a diary.
- This blog is not an experiment log.
- This blog documents a commercial mobile product production system.
- The goal is sustainable revenue generation through repeated app releases.

## 2. Core Direction

- All projects are commercial products.
- 001 and 002 are fixed and must not be changed.
- 003 and beyond follow expansion strategy.
- No experimental or portfolio-only positioning.

## 3. Revenue Model Rules

- All apps use an advertisement-based revenue model.
- Only Rewarded Ads are allowed.
- No forced interstitial ads.
- Ads must not severely damage user experience.
- Large-scale marketing is NOT assumed.

## 4. Platform Strategy

- Primary target: Android.
- iOS is secondary.
- Cross-platform is optional but not required initially.

## 5. Development Principles

- MVP first.
- Speed over perfection.
- Minimal maintenance cost.
- Offline-first when possible.
- Server dependency minimized.
- Reusable structure preferred.

## 6. Production Strategy (Mass Production Model)

- Build once, reuse structure.
- Reuse advertisement modules.
- Reuse UI templates.
- Keep feature scope small.
- Release → Collect Data → Improve → Repeat.

## 7. Blog Writing Format

Every project post must include:

1. Project Goal
2. Target User
3. Core Features (max 3)
4. Revenue Structure
5. Ad Placement Logic
6. Development Period
7. Maintenance Cost Structure
8. Scalability Possibility

## 8. Prohibited Content

- Emotional storytelling
- Developer struggles
- Abstract philosophy
- "Made for fun" statements
- Features unrelated to revenue
- Big-tech scale assumptions

## 9. Long-Term Strategy

- Increase total number of apps continuously.
- Small revenue per app is acceptable.
- Accumulated revenue structure is the goal.
- Maintain independent monetization per app.
- Leave room for future brand expansion.

## 10. AI Usage Policy

AI can:

- Suggest genres
- Optimize structure
- Improve monetization logic
- Assist in scalable system design

AI cannot:

- Modify direction of 001 and 002
- Suggest experimental-only projects
- Propose non-monetizable feature expansion

## 11. Tone & Writing Rules

- Use declarative sentences.
- Be execution-focused.
- Avoid unnecessary explanation.
- Be clear and direct.
- Avoid vague language.
